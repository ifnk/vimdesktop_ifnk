# What is VimDesktop

VimDesktop = Vim Mode At Desktop

Usages of VIM are really fascinating, every Vimer wants vim-like usage can be used in every single  program. Haven't you using [Vimperator](http://www.vimperator.org/) / [Pentadactyl](http://5digits.org/pentadactyl/) in Firefox, or [vimium](http://vimium.github.io/) in Chrome?

Yes! Yes! Yes!  
2012, a Chinese young guy named **Array** (linxinhong.sky At gmail.com) created **ViATc** (Vim Mode At Total Command) by using [ahk (AutoHotKey)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoHotkey). This 'little' plugin likes wings make Total Command fly like birds. Complex operations can be finished from keyboard. Most functions can be finished by twice(at most) pressings.

2013ï¼Œ ViATc renamed as VimD (Vim Mode At Desktop). It will make us do everything in desktop by using vim-like usage [We hope everything].

# Who should use VimDesktop
- **Vimer**: The guy who obsessed with keyboard and vim-like operation. And want vim-like operation used in every place.

- **User of Vimperator or Pentadactyl**: If the Vimperator or Pentadactyl is the most important reason of using Firefox, you mustn't missing VimDesktop.
- If you don't know what are they all above, and you happened like interesting tools, try VimDesktop!
